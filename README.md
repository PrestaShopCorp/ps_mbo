## About

The module **ps_mbo** is the PrestaShop modules marketplace within your shop Backoffice.

It is responsible for :

- Displaying the modules catalogue
- Actions on modules : install, uninstall, upgrade, ...
- Linking your backoffice to Addons

## Installation

MBO is integrated by default on PrestaShop Edition versions.

You can install it manually by downloading the latest release on https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/ps_mbo/releases and uploading it through the Module manager page of your Backoffice.

**Note :** An admin user (Prestashop Marketplace) is created when installing the module. This user is mandatory to allow the module to be callable by the external API.  

## Requirements

To be fully functional, MBO requires

- [ps_accounts][ps_accounts]
- **Your server must be callable by external referrers.** This is needed to perform actions on modules in your backoffice (install, upgrade, auto-upgrade, ...)
